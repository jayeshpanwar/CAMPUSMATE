# CampusMate: Smart Campus Companion 🤖

CampusMate is an AI-powered web application designed to be a central digital hub for college life.  It tackles the daily challenges of fragmented information across multiple platforms [cite: 30] , which often leads to confusion and missed opportunities for students[cite: 31].
